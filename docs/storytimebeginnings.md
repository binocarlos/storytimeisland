# The Story of the Time Island

"Mum you do pictures and stuff - why don't we make a book and stick it on the App Store or something?"

So - With these fateful words uttered at the kitchen table, the Davenport family embarked on a literary journey into the unknown.

## The fabled beginning

Because Story Time Island is actually a real place, Mum found it very easy to begin work on the books once she had visited.

She took a 2 week trip to the island, met everyone and heard them tell the famous stories of the island's history.

She got back brimming with ideas and started drawing like a woman possesed for the next 4 weeks.

Then - disaster struck - the portal that connected earth to the island closed and apparently, will only appear again in 47436847 years.

Story Time Island is now connected to another planet somewhere else in the universe, providing their children with colour and stories.

In the meantime, we have made it our mission to make books that tell those famous stories to the kids on Earth.

## The actual beginning

**Kai:** "Perhaps we should take a look at Java for Android and Objective C for iOS - oh, and there is PhoneGap"

**Mum:** "What?"

**Kai:** "Although that will need ADT and Eclipse, do we even have a droid phone?"

**Mum** (bemused): "Did you say cup of Tea? yes please"

**Ivy**: "I'll make the Tea"

**Kai**: "Perhaps we can use a Fortran system with an Oracle backend for the words in the book"

**Mum**: "My computer has crashed"

**Ivy**: "Here is some tea - oh, I've run out of water for my cup"

After much flaffing and more tea - Mum was drawing, I was coding and Ivy was swearing at HTML tags.

## Using something in a way it was not designed for

Here is advice - if you ever decide to 'use something in a way it was not designed for' - then you have to:

	make sure you know why

I spent about 7 months bashing, beating, twisting, hitting and coaxing HTML5 & CSS to do our 3d book turning effect.

As the weeks trickled past, I kept asking myself:

	why am I doing this?

I remember at one point walking down the stairs literally wailing at my mum 'I cannot face writing it again!'

So - it was nice the moment that the same book code ran on browser, Android and Apple all from one build : )
